## jqt
[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@srph/jqt.svg?style=flat-square)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@srph/jqt)

A *low-level* jQuery plugin for node hiding / showing through css transitions.

Think of it as a low-level version of builtin jQuery animations such as [`$.fadeOut`](http://api.jquery.com/fadeout/), [`$.fadeIn`](http://api.jquery.com/fadein/), [`$.slideUp`](http://api.jquery.com/slideup/), and [`$.slideDown`](http://api.jquery.com/slidedown/) but with css classes. Or maybe something similar to [ng-animate](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ngAnimate) or [ReactCSSTransitionGroup](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/animation.html) for single elements in jQuery.

Checkout the demo [examples](https://srph.github.io/jqt). If you prefer, you can also check out the [guide](guide.md) to get started!

## Use case
I've never found any similar libraries outside frameworks. This library was massively *dogfed* for projects I handle at work, usually for tab transitions, menu animations, etc.
