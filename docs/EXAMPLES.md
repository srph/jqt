# Examples
jqt is distributed with a few examples in its [source code](https://github.com/srph/jqt/tree/master/examples). If you're interested to run them locally:

```js
git clone https://github.com/srph/jqt.git

cd jqt
npm i
npm start
open examples/index.html
```

Otherwise, you can view them [online](http://jqt.netlify.com/) (all thanks to [Netlify](www.netlify.com)).
